Assigning job priority
======================

You might want to control the order in which your FireWorks are run. Setting job priority is simple. A few notes:

* You can assign any numerical value to the priority, including negative numbers and decimals. Higher priorities are run first.

 * FireWorks with *any* value of priority will be run before jobs without a priority defined. If two FireWorks have the same priority, one of those jobs will be chosen randomly (you can also choose FIFO and FILO ordering for equal-priority FireWorks via the :doc:`FW config </config_tutorial>`).

 * You can launch specific fireworks from the command line via `rlaunch singleshot -f FW_ID` or `qlaunch -r singleshot -f FW_ID`.

Set job priority using the command line after adding FWs
========================================================

If you would like to set the priority of a Firework *after* you have already entered it into the LaunchPad, you can do so via the command::

    lpad set_priority <PRIORITY> -i <FW_IDS>

where ``<FW_IDS>`` is the numerical id of the Firework you want to set the priority of (or a list of comma-separated ids), and ``<PRIORITY>`` is the priority to assign.

Instead of specifying ids, you can also specify a name (``-n``), a state (``-s``), or a custom query (``-q``). The full command is thus::

     lpad set_priority <PRIORITY> [-i FW_IDS] [-n NAME] [-s STATE] [-q QUERY]

Refer to the documentation (``lpad set_priority -h``) for more information.

Set job priority when creating FireWorks
========================================

To set job priority, simply set a key named ``_priority`` in your Firework spec to your desired priority. FireWorks will automatically prioritize jobs based on their value of this key.

Example 1: Prioritize one workflow over another
-----------------------------------------------

Imagine we have two workflows, A and B, with two steps each (1 and 2). We want to run workflow A in its entirety before beginning workflow B. Our execution should follow the blue arrow:

.. image:: _static/AthenB.png
   :width: 400px
   :align: center
   :alt: A then B

Let's examine how we can set up such an execution model.

#. Move to the ``A_then_B`` subdirectory of the ``priority`` tutorial directory in your installation directory::

    cd <INSTALL_DIR>/fw_tutorials/priority/A_then_B

#. Look inside the files ``wfA.yaml`` and ``wfB.yaml``. You'll notice that the ``_priority`` key for both steps of ``wfA.yaml`` is set to 2, whereas the corresponding values for the steps of ``wfB.yaml`` are only 1. This means that workflow A will execute in its entirety before starting workflow B.

#. Add and run the FireWorks to confirm::

    lpad reset
    lpad add *.yaml
    rlaunch -s rapidfire

#. You should have noticed text printed to the Terminal in the following order::

    Task A-1
    Task A-2
    Task B-1
    Task B-2

Example 2: A breadth-first workflow
-----------------------------------

Let's now try another execution order: A-1, B-1, B-2, A-2.

.. image:: _static/breadthfirst.png
   :width: 500px
   :align: center
   :alt: A then B

#. Move to the ``breadthfirst`` subdirectory of the ``priority`` tutorial directory in your installation directory::

    cd <INSTALL_DIR>/fw_tutorials/priority/breadthfirst

#. Look inside the files ``wfA.yaml`` and ``wfB.yaml``. You'll notice that this time, the ``_priority`` key is highest for step A-1 and lowest for step A-2, corresponding to our desired execution order.

#. Add and run the FireWorks to confirm::

    lpad reset
    lpad add *.yaml
    rlaunch -s rapidfire

#. You should have noticed text printed to the Terminal in the following order::

    Task A-1
    Task B-1
    Task B-2
    Task A-2
