Interpretation of 'state' of FWs and WFs
========================================

Recall that a Workflow is a composed of one or more FireWorks. Both FireWorks and Workflows have a *state* (status).

You can get the states of FireWorks and Workflows using :doc:`LaunchPad queries </query_tutorial>` or through the :doc:`web interface </basesite_tutorial>`.

FireWorks states
----------------

A Firework state represents the status of a single job.

============  ==============
  **State**    **Meaning**
------------  --------------
ARCHIVED      Similar to *deleted*. The Firework will not run, and its launches are archived (won't be used in duplicate checking). However, you can still query the Firework. More information :doc:`here </defuse_tutorial>`.
DEFUSED       The Firework is canceled/paused. Child FireWorks won't run (although siblings might). The Firework can be resumed (*reignited*) later. More information :doc:`here </defuse_tutorial>`.
WAITING       The Firework is waiting for a parent Firework to complete. The Rocket Launcher will not pull this Firework until parent jobs complete.
READY         This Firework is ready to run, but hasn't started running yet. The Rocket Launcher must pull this job and start running it.
RESERVED      (Queue Launcher in reservation mode only). The Firework is waiting in a queue to run. More information :doc:`here </queue_tutorial_pt2>`.
FIZZLED       The Firework has failed; it was executed but threw an error during the process. It can be rerun if desired - more information :doc:`here </failures_tutorial>`.
RUNNING       The Firework is currently running. Note that in catastrophic cases, a Firework may display this state even though it has crashed; more information :doc:`here </failures_tutorial>`.
COMPLETED     The Firework has successfully finished running.
============  ==============


Workflows states
----------------

The state of a Workflow depends on the states of its component FireWorks.

============  ==============
  **State**    **Meaning**
------------  --------------
ARCHIVED      Similar to *deleted*. All the individual Firework states are ARCHIVED.
COMPLETED     All the individual Firework states are COMPLETED - the workflow is finished.
DEFUSED       At least *one* Firework in the workflow is DEFUSED. (If you have a branching workflow, other FireWorks might be running).
FIZZLED       At least *one* Firework in the workflow is FIZZLED and no FWs are DEFUSED. (If you have a branching workflow, other FireWorks might be running).
RUNNING       At least one Firework is RUNNING or COMPLETED. This state means that workflow has started but is not yet fully complete.
RESERVED      No FireWorks are RUNNING or COMPLETED, but at least one Firework has been submitted to the queue.
READY         The workflow has not started running and no FireWorks are reserved to run.

Reserved keywords in FW spec
============================

The FW spec has certain **reserved keywords** that indicate special instructions to the FireWorks software. They are listed below:

========================  ==============
**Keyword**               **Meaning**
------------------------  --------------
_tasks                    Reserved for specifying the list of Firetasks in the spec.
_priority                 Used to specify the job's priority. More information :doc:`here </priority_tutorial>`.
_pass_job_info            This will pass a dictionary with keys ["fw_id", "fw_name", "launch_dir"] to the "_job_info" key. More information :doc:`here </dynamic_wf_tutorial>`.
_launch_dir               Pre-specify the directory to run the job rather than using default FW directory. More information :doc:`here </controlworker>`.
_fworker                  Used to control what resources run this job. More information :doc:`here </controlworker>`.
_category                 Used to control what resources run this job. More information :doc:`here </controlworker>`.
_queueadapter             Special queue parameters for this job. More information :doc:`here </queue_tutorial_pt2>`.
_add_fworker              Embeds FireWorker (``fireworker``) variable inside the Firetask just before runtime.
_add_launchpad_and_fw_id  Embeds LaunchPad (``launchpad``) and fw_id (``fw_id``) variables inside the Firetask just before runtime. Not best practice but maybe useful.
_dupefinder               Used to specify a duplicate finder object for avoiding duplicated runs. More information :doc:`here </duplicates_tutorial>`.
_allow_fizzled_parents    Run this Firework if all parents are *either* COMPLETED or FIZZLED.
_preserve_fworker         Run the children on the same FireWorker as the parent
_job_info                 Reserved for automatically putting information about previous jobs via the ``_pass_job_info`` option.
_fizzled_parents          Reserved for automatically putting information about FIZZLED parents in a child Firework with the ``_allow_fizzled_parents`` option.
_trackers                 Reserved for specifying Trackers.
_background_tasks         Reserved for specifying BackgroundTasks
_fw_env                   Reserved for setting worker-specific environment variables. More information :doc:`here </worker_tutorial>`.
_files_in                 Reserved for specifying a dict of {name: filename} for input files to be copied from preceding FW.
_files_out                Reserved for specifying a dict of {name, output file name} that can be copied by a child FW.
_files_prev               Reserved for storing the actual full filepaths if _files_out is specified.
