Controlling the directory and Worker of execution

Controlling the directory in which a Firework is executed
=========================================================

By default, FireWorks automatically creates a datestamped directory containing each job. This directory structure can be difficult to browse through manually, or you might need your runs in a particular directory format for another reason (e.g., to be compatible with a post-processing script).

To set the directory where a Firework will execute:

#. set the ``_launch_dir`` key in your Firework *spec* to the *full path* of the directory you want to execute the Firework in.

*(that's it!)*

Potential pitfalls
------------------

While setting execution directory is simple enough, there are a few pitfalls to consider when using this feature:

#. If you have multiple Workers, make sure that the ``_launch_dir`` you set is accessible from all Workers. Or, set things up so that only the correct Worker will pull your job (see next section).
#. If you direct multiple FireWorks into the same ``_launch_dir``, you might overwrite output files (like ``FW.json``).
#. If your code depends on having a particular directory structure in order to function, it's perhaps a sign that your code could be strengthened. For example, if you direct a job to a critical directory and it *fails* (e.g., due to a node crash), a rerun of that job might overwrite your original run because it's being directed to the same directory. This might not be your intended behavior.
#. Note that by default, FireWorks tries to clean (delete) the default FireWorks launch directory. If you find this is causing problems (it shouldn't), you can set ``REMOVE_USELESS_DIRS`` to False in the :doc:`FireWorks config </config_tutorial>`.

Alternatives to using _launch_dir
---------------------------------

Potential alternatives to using ``_launch_dir`` are:

#. If you are worried about finding your jobs on the filesystem, try :doc:`exploring all the features of LaunchPad queries <query_tutorial>`. In general, the database method of searching for jobs is much more powerful than browsing filesystems, especially if you set up your FireWorks *name* and *spec* to include things you care about in your search.
#. Another solution is to have your Firework write an empty file in its directory that has a name like "JOB--Cadmium" or "JOB--Silicon". Then you can quickly see what kind of job is in a bunch of ``launcher`` directories using a command like ``ls launcher*/JOB*`` - you'll see a list of launcher directories and which one contains "Cadmium" or "Silicon".
#. If you have a job that depends on knowing the location of other Firework runs, try writing your Firetasks to pass the location of execution to children using the *FWAction* object. Then, locations are passed dynamically in a true workflow fashion rather than hard-coded.

Of course, these are just suggestions. In the end, do what works!

Controlling the Worker that executes a Firework
===============================================

By default, any FireWorker can pull and run any Firework. However, in some cases you might want to control which computing resources should run a Firework. For example, if some of your FireWorks require a lot of memory and fast processors, you might want to direct those jobs to only a subset of FireWorkers that have sufficiently high computing specifications.

There are four methods to control where FireWorks are executed.

Method 1: Using name
--------------------

A simple method to direct FireWorks to FireWorks is by assigning the name of the resource where you want the job to run. You can do this by:

#. setting a ``_fworker`` key in your Firework spec **AND**
#. setting the ``name`` variable in your FireWorker to match that value

.. note:: Recall the ``my_fworker.yaml`` file from the :doc:`FireWorker tutorial </worker_tutorial>`. To set the FireWorker name, modify the ``name`` key.

Once you've set these values, job execution occurs as follows:

* FireWorks with a ``_fworker`` variable set will only run on a FireWorker with the exactly matching ``name`` variable.
* Note that this does not set any restriction on the jobs the FireWorker can pull, i.e. your FireWorker can pull matching FireWorks as well as any other FireWork. To restrict jobs pulled by the FireWorker, use the methods below (perhaps in addition to this method).

Method 2: Using categories
--------------------------

Another simple method to direct FireWorks to FireWorks is by assigning *categories*. You can do this by:

#. setting a ``_category`` key in your Firework spec **AND**
#. setting the ``category`` variable in your FireWorker to match that value

.. note:: Recall the ``my_fworker.yaml`` file from the :doc:`FireWorker tutorial </worker_tutorial>`. To set the FireWorker category, modify this file so that the ``category`` key is non-empty.

Once you've set these values, job execution occurs as follows:

* FireWorkers with no ``category`` variable set will be able to run **any** Firework (even FireWorks with a ``_category`` key in the spec!).
* FireWorkers with a ``_category`` variable set to the special keyword ``__none__`` will only be able to run Fireworks with  no ``_category`` key in the spec. If this option is set, it must be the only category for the FWorker.
* FireWorkers with a ``category`` set will only run the FireWorks with an exactly matching ``_category`` variable in the Firework spec.


And finally, a few final notes and limitations about this method:

* The same ``category`` can be shared by multiple FireWorkers (if desired).
* Each FireWorker can have a single String category (if that FireWorker should pull on a single category of job) or a list of String categories (if the FWorker should pull multiple categories of jobs)

Method 3: Using raw queries
---------------------------

A more flexible, but less intuitive method to restrict the FireWorks that a FireWorker through a raw MongoDB query. The query will restrict the FireWorker to only running FireWorks matching the query. For example, your query might specify that the ``spec.parameter1`` is under 100. In this case, FireWorks with ``spec.parameter1`` greater than 100 must be run elsewhere.

To set up a raw query:

#. set the ``query`` variable in your FireWorker to be a JSON String that can be interpreted by Pymongo.

.. note:: Recall the ``my_fworker.yaml`` file from the :doc:`FireWorker tutorial </worker_tutorial>`. To set the FireWorker query, modify this file so that the ``query`` key is non-empty. An example of a query string in YAML format would be ``'{"spec.parameter1": {"$lte":100}}'``

Note that if you set both a category and a query for a FireWorker, both constraints will be used.

Method 4: Running child Fireworks on the same resource as the parent
--------------------------------------------------------------------

If you want the a child Firework to run on the same FireWorker as the parent, set the ``_preserve_fworker`` key in the Firework spec of the *parent* to True. This will automatically pass the ``_fworker`` of the child to be the FWorker of the parent. See :doc:`reference <reference>` for more details.
